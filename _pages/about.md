## Welcome!

I'm a STScI Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)](https://www.stsci.edu). At STScI, I am part of the [ISM* Group](https://sites.google.com/view/ism-stsci/home). I study the effects of stellar feedback in nearby galaxies using multiwavelength observations of gas tracers. I combine and use data from ground and space-based observatories, including JWST, ALMA, and Hubble.

I grew up outside of Houston, Texas. I received my B.S. degrees in Astronomy and Physics at the University of Arizona. I earned my M.S. and Ph.D. in Astronomy at the University of Maryland. In addition to astronomy, I love trying new restaurants and cuisines, cooking, traveling, and hiking.
